------

#### [中文文档](https://github.com/JTSserver/Carpet1.13.2/blob/TIS-Server/docs/README_cn.md)

A fork of [gnembon's original CarpetMod for 1.13.2](https://github.com/gnembon/carpetmod). Thanks for gnembon's great tool allowing us to deal with bad performance of 1.13+.

## How to use:
------

- go to download the latest [release](https://github.com/JTSserver/Carpet1.13.2/releases)
- or go download latest build on [Jenkins](https://ci.tis.world/) (maybe unstable, but with latest features ofc)
- follow instructions in that zip file to patch vanilla server jar
- read command docs [here](https://github.com/JTSserver/Carpet1.13.2/blob/TIS-Server/docs/Features.md) or run `/carpet list` to see all options, run `/carpet <featureName>` for details.
